A dummy method is to the get the first 400-78(instruction token)-2(output token)=320 tokens(1260 characters) in the notes and drop the rest. Later, you will need to design your own method to truncate the notes. If you get an `CUDA OUT OF MEMORY` error during fine-tuning, you may come back to this cell and use a more strict token limit.

        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning a large language model **refers to the process of further training the pre-trained model on a specific task or domain using a smaller dataset.** The initial pre-training phase involves training a language model on a massive corpus of text data to learn general language patterns and representations. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, customizes the model to a specific task or domain by exposing it to task-specific data. By fine-tuning a large language model on a specific task, you leverage the pre-trained knowledge of the model while tailoring it to the nuances and requirements of your target task. This typically allows the model to perform better and achieve higher accuracy on the specific task compared to using the pretrained model by itself for your specific task.\n",

        "\n",
        "Pre-trained language models are often great at giving general answers, but they struggle when asked to follow specific instructions, especially for tasks in certain domains. To make a pre-trained model do better at these specific tasks, we can train it on examples of those tasks. This is called instruction fine-tuning. We use a dataset with pairs of `{instructions, outputs}` in the domain, and this helps the model learn to give the right response when given those types of instructions. This training process typically changes the underlying model weights, but there are also other ways to train it without doing this. When done correctly, this process teaches the model to understand and follow instructions it couldn't handle well before.\n",

        "- Involves training the entire pre-trained model on new data from scratch.\n",
        "- All model layers and parameters are updated during fine-tuning.\n",
        "- Can lead to high accuracy but requires a significant amount of computational resources and time.\n",
        "- Runs the risk of catastrophic forgetting: occasionally, since we are updating all of the weights in the model, this process can lead to the algorithm inadvertently losing knowledge of its past tasks, i.e., the knowledge it gained during pretraining. The outcome may vary, with the algorithm experiencing heightened error margins in some cases, while in others, it might completely erase the memory of a specific task leading to terrible performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Focuses on updating only a subset of the model's parameters.\n",
        "- Often involves freezing certain layers or parts of the model to avoid catastrophic forgetting, or inserting additional layers that are trainable while keeping the original model's weights frozen.\n",
